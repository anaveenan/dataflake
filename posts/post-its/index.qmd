This article is part of the "Day in life of a Data Scientist" series, sharing some of the real-world problems data scientist work on daily. The question: How do we measure the impact of launching of a machine learning the business metrics when A/B testing can't be done due to operational constraints ? 

Problem: 

We have developed an algorithm that helps agents perform outreach to maximize sales. Ideally, We would measure its impact using an A/B test, comparing the sales between agents using the model and those who aren't. However, the operatinal challenges made running a A/B testing impractical. 

Solution: 

The solution to this problem is to use Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis.
